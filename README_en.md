# NewEden Memories

Many years ago, I would make some small tools for Eve for personal use. Later on, the functions gradually increased. Although each function was simple, I found that it could still be shared with everyone. Therefore, I launched the first version of The Guide To The NewEden.

If you are fortunate enough to have seen the V1 version above, then you must be rich now. Unfortunately, after the V1 version was updated for a period of time. The software came to a temporary end.

# Newborn
